This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using decision tree and ensemble learning techniques. Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, selecting relevant features, and discretizing continuous variables for compatibility with decision trees. A decision tree model is optimized using GridSearchCV and further compared to an ensemble of decision trees and a random forest classifier to improve prediction accuracy. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are evaluated to assess the model's effectiveness.
